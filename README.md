ðŸ•’ Flutter Stopwatch
This project is a simple yet functional stopwatch application built with Flutter. It features start, stop, reset, and lap time recording capabilities with millisecond precision. The UI follows Material Design guidelines, offering a clean and intuitive interface that works seamlessly across mobile devices.

Special thanks to the Flutter team for their excellent framework, and to the open-source community for various packages that made development smoother. I'd also like to acknowledge online learning resources like Flutter documentation and Stack Overflow that provided solutions to several challenges encountered during development.

The app architecture follows basic state management principles using setState(), making it beginner-friendly for those learning Flutter. Key widgets like ListView.builder display lap times efficiently, while the Stopwatch class from dart:core handles the core timing functionality.

Future improvements might include adding theme customization, sound effects, or persistence of lap times. Contributions and suggestions are welcome â€“ feel free to fork the repository or submit issues for any bugs found.
